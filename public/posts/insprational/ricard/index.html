<p>Achieving goals doesn&rsquo;t always bring lasting happiness. Once a goal is accomplished, new ones often emerge, leading to a cycle of pursuit. The phenomenon of habituation to success is powerful and can hinder long-term satisfaction. To counter this, researchers suggest focusing on enduring accomplishments, which address four major needs:</p>
