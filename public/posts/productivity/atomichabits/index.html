Understanding these components aids in comprehending how habits form and how to enhance them. Transform these steps into a practical framework, the Four Laws of Behavior Change, to design good habits and eliminate bad ones.\nHow to create a good habit: 1st Law (Cue): Make it obvious. 2nd Law (Craving): Make it attractive. 3rd Law (Response): Make it easy. 4th Law (Reward): Make it satisfying. How to break a bad habit: Inversion of the 1st Law (Cue): Make it invisible. Inversion of the 2nd Law (Craving): Make it unattractive. Inversion of the 3rd Law (Response): Make it difficult. Inversion of the 4th Law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.
