### What’s the Book About?
Life is not always easy. You face small troubles like losing your keys or big ones like losing a job. Jeff Keller says you can still be happy and successful! His big idea is: *“Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react.”* This means your attitude—how you think and feel—controls your life. Keller was a lawyer who hated his work. He felt stuck and sad. Then he changed his attitude, left his job, and became a speaker who helps people feel strong. The book has three parts: **Think Good**, **Speak Good**, and **Do Good**. Each part has stories and lessons to show you how to make your life better. It’s like a map to happiness!

### Part 1: Think Good – Start in Your Head
Your thoughts are powerful. If you think good things, good things happen. Keller explains this step by step.

#### Chapter 1: Attitude Is Like a Window
- **Idea**: Your attitude is how you look at life. It’s like a window. A clean window (good attitude) lets you see opportunities. A dirty window (bad attitude) shows only problems.
- **Story**: Sara and Sam go to a coffee shop. The waiter spills coffee on their table. Sara laughs, wipes it up, and says, “No big deal!” She leaves happy. Sam gets mad, shouts at the waiter, and storms out feeling worse. Same spill, but different reactions!
- **More Details**: Keller says life throws dirt—like rude people or bad days—on your window. You can’t stop the dirt, but you can clean it. Sara cleaned her window with a smile. Sam let his stay dirty with anger.
- **Lesson**: You can’t control everything, but you can choose your attitude. Wipe away the bad with happy thoughts. It’s like choosing sunshine over rain!

#### Chapter 2: You Attract What You Think
- **Idea**: Your thoughts are like a magnet. Think about success, and success comes closer. Think about failure, and failure finds you.
- **Story**: Keller was a lawyer who felt unhappy every day. He thought, “I’m stuck forever.” Then he read books about positive thinking. He started imagining a new life—speaking to big crowds, helping people. Soon, he got chances to speak, and his dream began!
- **More Details**: At first, Keller didn’t believe it would work. But he kept thinking happy thoughts—like seeing himself on stage. One day, someone asked him to give a talk. Then another. His thoughts pulled in good things!
- **Lesson**: Focus on what you want, not what you don’t want. Happy thoughts bring happy results. It’s slow, but it’s real!

#### Chapter 3: Imagine Your Success
- **Idea**: Picture your dreams clearly in your mind. It’s like watching a movie of your future. This helps your brain work toward it.
- **Story**: Jim Carrey was a poor actor with no money. He wrote a check for $10 million to himself and said, “This is for acting.” He kept it in his wallet and imagined being a big star. Years later, he got a movie role that paid him $10 million!
- **More Details**: Jim didn’t just wish. Every night, he drove to a hill, looked at the city, and saw himself in movies. He felt the excitement. His mind believed it, and his actions followed.
- **Lesson**: See yourself winning—every detail, every feeling. Maybe you imagine a new job or a happy family. Keep picturing it. It takes time, but it pushes you to make it happen!

#### Chapter 4: Promise to Work Hard
- **Idea**: Make a strong promise to yourself: “I will do this!” Then don’t stop, even when it’s hard. This moves mountains!
- **Story**: David Baldacci was a lawyer with a busy day job. He loved writing stories. Every night, from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., he wrote books. Publishers said “no” many times. He kept going for years. Finally, his books sold millions!

#### Chapter 5: Problems Can Help You
- **Idea**: Bad times are not the end. They teach you. A good attitude turns problems into chances to grow.
- **Story**: Dave Bruno had a terrible car crash. He broke bones and lost money. He could have given up. Instead, he thought, “What can I do now?” He used the time to plan a new life and found a better path.
- **More Details**: Dave was in pain and scared. But he asked, “How can this help me?” He rested, thought, and decided to chase a dream he’d ignored. The crash became his start, not his stop.

#### Chapter 8: Don’t Complain
- **Idea**: Complaining makes you feel worse and pushes people away. Stop it and focus on good things.
- **Story**: Keller used to complain about his lawyer job. “It’s boring. I hate it,” he’d say. He felt more tired and sad. One day, he stopped. He said, “I’m thankful for my skills.” His energy came back, and he found a new path!
- **More Details**: Complaining was a habit for Keller. He’d talk to friends about his bad days. They got bored. When he switched to positive talk, they listened, and he felt happier.
